## Modify Font Style in CSS

Text used within elements can be modified with CSS. This includes the type of the font (font-family) as well as the weight, size, and style.

One of the most basic things we cand with our text is affect the size of it by using `font-size`.

`font-style` has the values `italic`, `normal`, `oblique`, and `unset`.

You can also change the style of your font via `font-family`.

Some other font-related styling we can do is:

- `letter-spacing` - the width between each letter.
- `text-transform` - controls the capilization of text. Valid [values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-transform.asp).
- `font-weight` - defines the thickness of the text. Valid [values](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_weight.asp).

We can condense our styles into the `font` shorthand:

`font: italic 300 34px 'Open Sans', sans-serif;`
